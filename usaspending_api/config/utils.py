    NOTE: This functions's signature follows that of pydantic validator functions, because it is to be delegated to
    from validator functions.

    Args:
        config_class (TBaseSettings): The class inheriting from pydantic.BaseSettings who is being instantiated. It
            is NOT (necessarily) the class on which this config_var (or its validator) resides.

        config_var (ModelField): The pydantic setting aka field aka configuration variable for which to
            factory-derive a value

        assigned_or_sourced_value (Any): The value that pydantic found for this config var. It could be coming from
            an assignment, or from a config source, like environment variables.

        configured_vars (Dict[str, Any]): Dictionary of configuration variables that have been seen/processed (IN
            ORDER) by pydantic already. Note: due to the fact that validators are processed in the order of
            ModelFields in the model being seen, this dictionary may not be inclusive of ALL fields in the model (of
            all configuration variables), simply because they haven't been seen/processed yet.

        factory_func (Callable): A lambda or callable function passed in
            which will be invoked to produce a value for the field. The provided factory function is assumed to be a
            closure, enclosing variable values it needs in its scoped defniition so they don't need to be passed in.
            See Example below for a no-param lambda closure

        Example:
            >>> @validator("MY_COMPOSED_FIELD")
            >>> def _MY_COMPOSED_FIELD(cls, v, values, field: ModelField):
